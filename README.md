# BestTeas
## Overall Goal
The motivation behind this project was to allow users to match with other people from their schools and become "besties" and create a new friendship, maybe even over a cup of tea.

## How it works
This project was developed using Android Studio. It is a mobile application where users can register by entering their name, selecting a school they go to from the drop down list, write a bio for other users to read, meet other users from their school by swiping through their profiles, and eventually chatting with each other. Once both users swipe right on each other, they will be able to message each other.

This project was developed using Android Studios. It is a mobile application where users can meet other people from their school by swiping through their profiles and chatting with them.
Once both users swipe right on each other, they will be able to message each other. The motivation behind this project was to allow users to match with other people from their schools and become "besties" and maybe go to a tea shop.
